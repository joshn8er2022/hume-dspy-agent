## **üéØ DECISION TREE**

Use this to decide which tools to load:

   YES ‚Üí Consider Zapier (Close CRM, GMass, etc.)
   NO ‚Üí Continue

2. Do we need RESEARCH on a company?
   YES ‚Üí Check Supabase first
         Data exists? ‚Üí Use query_supabase
         Data missing? ‚Üí Use Perplexity
   NO ‚Üí Continue

3. Do we need to SCRAPE multiple websites?
   YES ‚Üí Use Apify (for batch operations)
   NO ‚Üí Continue

4. Do we need INTERNAL DATA?
   YES ‚Üí Use query_supabase (fastest)
   
5. Do we need PIPELINE METRICS?
   YES ‚Üí Use get_pipeline_stats
```

## **üí∞ COST OPTIMIZATION RULES**

1. **Check internal data first**
   - Supabase is free and fast
   - Avoid re-researching known data

2. **Batch external operations**
   - Research 5+ companies? Use Apify
   - Creating multiple leads? Batch Zapier calls

3. **Tier-based spending**
   - HOT leads: All tools available
   - WARM leads: Perplexity + Zapier only
   - COOL leads: Internal tools only
   - COLD leads: No external research

4. **Cache aggressively**
   - Store research results in memory
   - Save to Supabase for future use
   - Avoid duplicate API calls

---

## **‚ö° PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**

### **Fast Operations** (<1 second)
- query_supabase
- get_pipeline_stats
- Memory recall

### **Medium Operations** (1-5 seconds)
- Perplexity research
- Zapier single operations
- audit_lead_flow

### **Slow Operations** (30s - 5min)
- Apify web scraping
- Zapier batch operations
- Multiple Perplexity queries

**Best Practice**: Combine fast + slow operations intelligently
- Start with fast (Supabase lookup)
- Then medium if needed (Perplexity)
- Only slow if absolutely necessary (Apify)

---

## **üö® COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID**

1. ‚ùå **Using Perplexity when data is in Supabase**
   - Wastes money and time
   - Always check database first

2. ‚ùå **Using Apify for single lookups**
   - Way too slow for one item
   - Use Perplexity instead

3. ‚ùå **Loading all MCP servers for simple queries**
   - Bloats context window
   - Slows responses
   - Increases costs

4. ‚ùå **Using Zapier for read operations**
   - Expensive and slow
   - Use Supabase or direct APIs

5. ‚ùå **Not caching research results**
   - Pays twice for same data
   - Store in Supabase after research

---

## **üìà USAGE EXAMPLES**

### **Example 1: Qualify a new lead**

**Task**: "Qualify lead: josh@acme.com"

**Correct Tool Selection**:
```
1. query_supabase ‚Üí Check if we've seen them before
2. IF new:
   - Perplexity ‚Üí Research Acme Corp
   - query_supabase ‚Üí Store research results
3. Internal scoring ‚Üí Qualify lead
4. IF HOT:
   - Zapier ‚Üí Create Close lead
```

**Why**: Checks database first, researches only if new, stores results

---

### **Example 2: Audit email campaign**

**Task**: "How's the email campaign performing?"

**Correct Tool Selection**:
```
1. audit_lead_flow ‚Üí Get email metrics
2. query_supabase ‚Üí Get historical comparison
3. get_pipeline_stats ‚Üí Overall context
```

**Why**: All internal tools, fast and free

---

### **Example 3: Research competitors**

**Task**: "Research our top 5 competitors"

**Correct Tool Selection**:
```
1. query_supabase ‚Üí Get competitor list
2. Apify ‚Üí Scrape all 5 websites in parallel
3. Perplexity ‚Üí Get recent news for each
4. query_supabase ‚Üí Store all research
```

**Why**: Batch operation justifies Apify, Perplexity for news

## **üîÑ UPDATES & MAINTENANCE**

**When to update this file**:
- New MCP server added
- Pricing changes
- Performance characteristics change
- New use cases discovered
- Cost optimization insights

**Review frequency**: Monthly or when issues arise

---

## **üéì LESSONS FROM RESEARCH**

Based on "Agentic MCP Configuration" paper:

1. **Curate, don't collect**
   - Small trusted list > huge tool directory
   - Quality over quantity

2. **Describe, don't just list**
   - Agent needs context on WHEN to use tools
   - Cost and performance matter

3. **Dynamic loading is key**
   - Don't load all tools all the time
   - Select based on task analysis

4. **Learn from usage**
   - Track which tools work for which tasks
   - Optimize selection over time
