# Project Summary: hume-dspy-agent Enhancement

**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Objective:** Transform basic lead qualification bot into fully autonomous agentic system

---

## What We Built

### 🎯 Core Achievement
Transformed your lead routing system from a **reactive** webhook processor into a **proactive autonomous agent** that manages the entire lead lifecycle with minimal human intervention.

---

## Architecture Improvements

### Before (v1.0)
```
Typeform → Webhook → DSPy Qualification → Slack Notification → END
```
**Problems:**
- No follow-up automation
- No state tracking
- No persistent engagement
- Manual follow-ups required

### After (v2.0)
```
Typeform → Webhook → DSPy Qualification → Slack Thread Creation
                                              ↓
                                         LangGraph Agent
                                              ↓
                        ┌─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┐
                        ↓                     ↓                     ↓
                   Auto Email           Slack Updates         State Mgmt
                        ↓                     ↓                     ↓
                  GMass Send          Thread Replies        Redis/Memory
                        ↓                     ↓                     ↓
                  Follow-ups           Progress Track      Persistence
                   (Scheduled)           (Real-time)      (Resume-able)
```

---

## New Capabilities

### 1. **Autonomous Follow-up Agent** (LangGraph)
- **Stateful Decision-Making:** Agent remembers where it left off
- **Smart Cadence:**
  - HOT leads: Follow up every 4 hours (max 5 attempts)
  - WARM leads: Follow up every 24 hours (max 3 attempts)
  - COLD leads: Follow up every 48 hours (max 2 attempts)
- **Auto-Escalation:** Immediately alerts @channel when leads respond
- **Auto-Cold-Marking:** Stops attempting after max follow-ups
- **Resume-able:** Can pick up where it left off if system restarts

### 2. **Slack Threading** (Real-time Updates)
Each lead gets its own conversation thread:

**Example Flow:**
```
[Initial Message]
🔥 New HOT Lead: Sarah Johnson
Email: sarah@clinic.com
Score: 87/100

[4 minutes later - Thread Reply]
✅ Initial outreach email sent to Sarah
⏳ Waiting for response...

[4 hours later - Thread Reply]
📧 Follow-up #1 sent to Sarah
⏱️ Last contact: 0h ago
⏳ Next follow-up in 4h

[2 hours later - Thread Reply]
🔥🔥🔥 HOT LEAD RESPONSE RECEIVED! 🔥🔥🔥
Sarah (sarah@clinic.com) has responded!
@channel - Someone should reach out ASAP!
```

### 3. **Enhanced Tech Stack**
- **LangGraph:** State machine for autonomous agents
- **Claude (Anthropic):** Superior reasoning for complex decisions
- **Celery + Redis:** Scheduled tasks for timed follow-ups
- **Pydantic v2:** Stricter type safety
- **FastAPI:** Async webhook handling

---

## Security Fixes Applied

### Critical Vulnerabilities Remediated ✅
1. **Removed hardcoded Supabase credentials** (was valid until 2075!)
2. **Removed hardcoded GMass API key**
3. **Enabled fail-closed webhook verification** (was accepting all requests)
4. **Disabled debug mode in production**
5. **Added environment variable validation** (fails fast if missing)
6. **Removed API key logging** (PII/compliance risk)

### Security Improvements
- Webhook signature verification (HMAC)
- No credentials in code
- Fail-closed by default
- PII redaction in logs

### Still TODO (Medium Priority)
- Rate limiting on endpoints
- Request size limits
- CORS restriction to specific origins

# Slack Integration (NEW)
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...                 # Create Slack app, enable bot
SLACK_CHANNEL=inbound-leads              # Create this channel

# Email (OPTIONAL but recommended)
GMASS_API_KEY=<NEW_rotated_key>
FROM_EMAIL=hello@yourcompany.com

# Infrastructure (for scheduled tasks)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0       # Railway provides this

# Environment
ENVIRONMENT=production
DEBUG=false
```

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. **Prepare Credentials** (30 minutes)
- [ ] Rotate Supabase keys (old ones were exposed!)
- [ ] Get Anthropic API key
- [ ] Create Slack bot and get token
- [ ] Create `#inbound-leads` Slack channel
- [ ] Invite bot to channel
- [ ] Get Typeform webhook secret

### 2. **Railway Setup** (15 minutes)
```bash
# Link to Railway project
railway link

# Add Redis database (via Railway dashboard)
# Click "New" → "Database" → "Redis"

# Set all environment variables
railway variables set SUPABASE_URL="..."
railway variables set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."
railway variables set SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="..."
# ... (see full list in DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)

# Deploy
railway up
```

### 3. **Configure Typeform** (5 minutes)
- Go to Typeform → form → Integrations → Webhooks
- Add URL: `https://your-app.railway.app/webhooks/typeform`
- Copy secret to Railway env vars

### 4. **Test End-to-End** (10 minutes)
- Submit test form
- Check Slack for notification
- Verify thread is created
- Wait for follow-up (4h for HOT, 24h for WARM)
- Verify thread update appears

---

## What Happens Now (Autonomous Flow)

### When a Lead Submits the Form:

**Minute 0:** Lead submits Typeform
- Webhook received and signature verified
- Pydantic validates payload structure
- Lead model created (form-agnostic)
- DSPy qualifies lead (score + tier)
- Slack thread created with initial message
- **LangGraph agent starts autonomously**

**Minute 1:** Agent assesses and takes action
- Determines follow-up cadence based on tier
- Sends initial email via GMass
- Updates Slack thread: "✅ Email sent"
- Schedules next check (via Celery)
- Saves state to Redis

**4 Hours Later** (for HOT lead):
- Celery task wakes up agent
- Agent checks: has lead responded?
  - **If YES:** Posts "🔥🔥🔥 RESPONSE!" and @channels team
  - **If NO:** Sends follow-up email, updates Slack, reschedules

**8 Hours Later** (no response):
- Agent sends follow-up #2
- Updates Slack thread with progress
- Reschedules next check

**After 5 Follow-ups** (max reached):
- Agent marks lead as COLD
- Posts final Slack update
- Moves to nurture campaign
- **Stops autonomous loop**

---

## Key Benefits

### For Your Team
- **No Manual Follow-ups:** Agent handles everything
- **Real-time Visibility:** All updates in Slack threads
- **Instant Escalation:** Hot leads get immediate @channel alerts
- **Never Miss a Lead:** Persistent state means nothing falls through cracks

### For Your Business
- **Faster Response Times:** 4-hour cadence for hot leads
- **Consistent Engagement:** Every lead gets same quality follow-up
- **Data-Driven:** All interactions logged to Supabase
- **Scalable:** Can handle 1000s of leads/month with no additional work

### Technical Excellence
- **Type-Safe:** Pydantic validation prevents runtime errors
- **Testable:** Clear separation of concerns
- **Observable:** Structured logging throughout
- **Maintainable:** Clean architecture, well-documented

## Recommendations on Framework

### Your Question: "What do you think about DSPy, Pydantic, LangGraph?"

**My Assessment:**

**DSPy (Excellent for Qualification):**
- ✅ **KEEP:** Perfect for structured LLM tasks like lead scoring
- ✅ **Strength:** Chain-of-Thought reasoning gives explainable decisions
- ✅ **Use Case:** Qualification, scoring, template generation
- ⚠️ **Limitation:** Not great for stateful, multi-step agents

**Pydantic (Essential):**
- ✅ **KEEP:** Foundation of FastAPI and data validation
- ✅ **Strength:** Type safety prevents 90% of bugs
- ✅ **Use Case:** API validation, config management, data models
- 🎯 **Best Practice:** Use Pydantic v2 for better performance

**LangGraph (Perfect for Agentic Behavior):**
- ✅ **EXCELLENT CHOICE:** Built specifically for autonomous agents
- ✅ **Strength:** State persistence, conditional routing, human-in-loop
- ✅ **Use Case:** Multi-step workflows, autonomous decision-making
- 🚀 **Recommendation:** This is the RIGHT tool for your agentic needs

**Claude SDK (Anthropic):**
- ✅ **RECOMMENDED:** Better reasoning than GPT-4 for complex decisions
- ✅ **Strength:** Tool use, function calling, longer context (200K tokens)
- ✅ **Use Case:** LangGraph agent decision-making, complex reasoning
- 💡 **Tip:** Use Claude for agent, keep DSPy for qualification (best of both)

### Framework Strategy (My Recommendation):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            Your Use Cases                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Lead Qualification → DSPy (keep)            │
│  Autonomous Follow-ups → LangGraph (new)     │
│  Data Validation → Pydantic (essential)      │
│  Complex Reasoning → Claude (via LangGraph)  │
│  Scheduled Tasks → Celery (infrastructure)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Don't Add:**
- ❌ **LangChain alone** (LangGraph is better for agents)
- ❌ **AutoGPT/BabyAGI** (too experimental, LangGraph is production-ready)
- ❌ **Custom state machine** (LangGraph handles this)

**Consider Adding Later:**
- 🤔 **Temporal** (if you outgrow Celery for workflow orchestration)
- 🤔 **PostHog** (for product analytics on lead behavior)
- 🤔 **Sentry** (for error tracking in production)

## System Prompt vs. Hard-Coded Logic

### Your Question: "How much should be in system prompt vs. hard-coded?"

**My Approach (What I Built):**

**Hard-Coded (Deterministic):**
```python
# Tier-based cadence rules (hard-coded)
if tier == HOT:
    follow_up_hours = 4  # Fast follow-up
elif tier == WARM:
    follow_up_hours = 24  # Daily
else:
    follow_up_hours = 48  # Every 2 days

# Max follow-up limits (hard-coded)
max_follow_ups = {
    "HOT": 5,
    "WARM": 3,
    "COLD": 2
}
```

**AI-Driven (Adaptive):**
```python
# Email content (AI-generated via DSPy)
email_template = generate_email(
    lead_name=name,
    company=company,
    tier=tier
)  # Personalized per lead

# Slack message tone (AI-adapted)
if tier == "HOT":
    system_prompt = "Be urgent and action-oriented"
else:
    system_prompt = "Be informative and patient"
```

**Recommended Balance:**

| Component | Hard-Coded | AI-Driven | Reason |
|-----------|------------|-----------|--------|
| Follow-up timing | ✅ | ❌ | Business rules, must be predictable |
| Max attempts | ✅ | ❌ | Compliance, spam prevention |
| Email content | ❌ | ✅ | Personalization improves response |
| Lead scoring | ❌ | ✅ | Complex patterns, adaptive |
| Escalation logic | ✅ | ❌ | Critical alerts, must be reliable |
| Slack tone | 🔀 | ✅ | Mix: Format hard-coded, tone AI |

**Golden Rule:**
- **Hard-code business rules** (SLAs, compliance, critical paths)
- **AI-generate content** (emails, summaries, personalization)
- **AI-assist decisions** (scoring, prioritization, routing)
