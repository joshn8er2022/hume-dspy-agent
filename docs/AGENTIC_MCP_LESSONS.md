# üéì Agentic MCP Configuration: Lessons Learned & Implementation Plan

**Date**: October 19, 2025, 11:30 PM PST  
**Source**: [PulseMCP - Agentic MCP Configuration](https://www.pulsemcp.com/posts/agentic-mcp-configuration)  
**Status**: Analysis Complete + Actionable Recommendations

---

## **üìã EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The paper introduces **"Agentic MCP Configuration"** as a superior solution to "tool overload" - the problem of having too many tools that bloat context windows and degrade performance.

**Key Insight**: Instead of loading all tools upfront (or using RAG to select them), let agents **dynamically select and load** only the MCP servers needed for each specific task.

**Our Current State**: We have the foundation (MCP client + Instrument Manager) but need to implement the full agentic loop.

---

## **üîë KEY CONCEPTS FROM THE PAPER**

### **1. The Tool Overload Problem**

**Traditional Approach**:
```
Agent starts
‚Üí Loads ALL available tools (200+)
‚Üí Context window bloated
‚Üí Performance degrades
‚Üí LLM confused by irrelevant tools
```

**Why This Fails**:
- 200+ tools in every prompt = massive token waste
- LLM struggles to select correct tool from hundreds
- Slower responses, higher costs
- Many tools irrelevant to current task

---

### **2. Agentic MCP Configuration Solution**

**New Approach**:
```
Agent starts with minimal tools
‚Üí Analyzes task
‚Üí Selects 3-5 relevant servers from trusted list
‚Üí Dynamically loads ONLY those servers
‚Üí Executes task with lean context
```

**Why This Works**:
- Small, focused tool set per task
- Fast LLM decision-making
- Lower costs (fewer tokens)
- Scales to thousands of potential tools

---

### **3. The Three-File System**

#### **File 1: Trusted Servers List** (`trusted_servers.md`)
```markdown
## com.zapier/mcp
Used for CRM operations, email automation, and business integrations.
Only load when explicitly working with Close CRM, GMass, or other Zapier apps.

## com.perplexity/research  
Used for real-time web research and competitive intelligence.
Load when researching companies, markets, or recent developments.

## com.apify/web-scraping
Used for extracting data from websites and web automation.
Only load when explicitly scraping websites or extracting web data.
```

**Purpose**: Curated list of YOUR trusted MCP servers with when/why to use each

---

#### **File 2: Installation Config** (`servers.json`)
```json
[
  {
    "name": "com.zapier/mcp",
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["/path/to/mcp-server"],
    "env": {
      "ZAPIER_API_KEY": "${ZAPIER_API_KEY}"
    }
  }
]
```

**Purpose**: Standardized installation instructions (MCP Registry standard)

---

#### **File 3: Agentic Loop** (Code)

**Required Capabilities**:
1. `find_servers(task)` - Analyze task, return relevant server names
2. `install_servers(names)` - Dynamically load selected servers
3. `init_subagent()` - Spin up properly-configured subagent
4. `chat(prompt)` - Hand off task to subagent

---

### **4. Why Agentic > RAG**

**RAG-MCP Approach**:
```
User: "The button doesn't work"
‚Üí Embed query into vector
‚Üí Search 1000+ tool embeddings
‚Üí Return "most similar" tools
‚Üí ‚ùå Might return wrong tools (semantic similarity ‚â† task relevance)
```

**Agentic Approach**:
```
User: "The button doesn't work"  
‚Üí LLM analyzes: "This is a UI bug in web app context"
‚Üí LLM selects: Playwright (browser automation)
‚Üí Loads ONLY Playwright
‚Üí ‚úÖ Perfect tool for the job
```

**Winner**: Agentic (same way agentic code search > RAG for codebases)

---

### **5. Future: Tool Groups (SEP-1300)**

**Problem**: Some MCP servers expose 100+ tools
- Example: GitHub MCP server has Issues, PRs, Discussions, Repos, Stargazers, etc.

**Solution**: Tool Groups
```python
github_server.enable_groups(["issues", "pull_requests"])
# Loads only Issues + PRs tools, not all 100+
```

**Impact**: Even more granular control, better context management

---

## **üîç HOW THIS APPLIES TO OUR SYSTEM**

### **What We Already Have** ‚úÖ

1. **MCP Client** (Phase 0.5.1)
   - Zapier MCP (200+ tools)
   - Close CRM (60+ tools)
   - Perplexity (research)
   - Apify (web scraping)

2. **Instrument Manager** (Phase 0.5.3)
   - Semantic tool discovery (like `find_servers`)
   - Vector-based search
   - Category organization
   - Dynamic registration

3. **Memory System** (Phase 0.5.2)
   - Remembers past tool usage
   - Can learn which tools work for which tasks

---

### **What We're Missing** ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **No Trusted Servers List**
   - No markdown file describing when to use each MCP server
   - Agent doesn't know which servers are "expensive" to load
   - No guidance on server selection strategy

2. **No Dynamic Server Loading**
   - All MCP servers loaded at startup (always)
   - Can't selectively enable/disable servers per task
   - Context bloat from unused tools

3. **No Subagent Delegation**
   - Can't spin up specialized subagents
   - Can't hand off tasks to properly-configured agents
   - No recursive agent architecture

4. **No Task-Based Tool Selection**
   - Instruments registered but not task-aware
   - No automatic server selection logic
   - Manual tool calling only

---

## **üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

### **Phase 0.7: Agentic MCP Configuration** (3-5 days)

#### **Step 1: Create Trusted Servers List** (1 hour)

**File**: `/config/trusted_mcp_servers.md`

```markdown
# Trusted MCP Servers - Hume AI B2B Sales Automation

## com.zapier/mcp
**When to Use**:
- Creating/updating leads in Close CRM
- Automating email sequences via GMass
- Managing business workflows

**When NOT to Use**:
- Simple data queries (use Supabase directly)
- Research tasks (use Perplexity instead)
- Read-only operations (too expensive)

**Cost**: High (API calls to Zapier + downstream services)

## com.perplexity/research
**When to Use**:
- Researching companies (funding, news, team)
- Competitive intelligence
- Market research
- Finding recent information (< 6 months old)

**When NOT to Use**:
- Company data we already have in Supabase
- Historical analysis (use our database)
- Structured data extraction (use Clearbit/Apollo)

**Cost**: Medium (per-query pricing)

## com.apify/web-scraping
**When to Use**:
- Extracting data from websites at scale
- Monitoring competitor websites
- Building lead lists from web sources

**When NOT to Use**:
- Single-page lookups (use Perplexity)
- Data available via API (use that instead)
- Real-time research (too slow)

**Cost**: High (compute-intensive)

## Internal Tools (Always Available)
- audit_lead_flow: Data quality audits
- query_supabase: Database queries
- get_pipeline_stats: Analytics
```

**Benefits**:
- Agent knows WHEN to use each server
- Understands cost implications
- Makes smarter selection decisions

---

#### **Step 2: Implement Dynamic Server Selection** (2 days)

**File**: `/agents/mcp_orchestrator.py`

```python
class MCPOrchestrator:
    """Dynamically selects and loads MCP servers based on task."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.trusted_servers = self._load_trusted_servers()
        self.active_servers = {}  # Currently loaded servers
    
    async def select_servers_for_task(self, task: str) -> List[str]:
        """Use LLM to analyze task and select relevant servers.
        
        Args:
            task: User's task description
        
        Returns:
            List of server names to activate
        """
        # Use DSPy to analyze task and select servers
        selector = dspy.Predict(ServerSelection)
        result = selector(
            task_description=task,
            trusted_servers=self.trusted_servers,
            current_context="Hume AI B2B sales automation"
        )
        
        return result.selected_servers
    
    async def load_servers(self, server_names: List[str]):
        """Dynamically load selected MCP servers.
        
        Only loads servers that aren't already active.
        """
        for name in server_names:
            if name not in self.active_servers:
                logger.info(f"üì¶ Loading MCP server: {name}")
                server = await self._initialize_server(name)
                self.active_servers[name] = server
    
    async def unload_servers(self, server_names: List[str]):
        """Unload servers to free up context."""
        for name in server_names:
            if name in self.active_servers:
                logger.info(f"üì§ Unloading MCP server: {name}")
                await self.active_servers[name].shutdown()
                del self.active_servers[name]

class ServerSelection(dspy.Signature):
    """Select which MCP servers to use for a task."""
    
    task_description = dspy.InputField(desc="The task to accomplish")
    trusted_servers = dspy.InputField(desc="List of trusted servers with descriptions")
    current_context = dspy.InputField(desc="Current system context")
    
    selected_servers = dspy.OutputField(desc="Comma-separated list of server names to activate")
    reasoning = dspy.OutputField(desc="Why these servers were selected")
```

---

#### **Step 3: Integrate with StrategyAgent** (1 day)

**Modify**: `/agents/strategy_agent.py`

```python
class StrategyAgent(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        # ... existing init ...
        
        # Phase 0.7: Agentic MCP Configuration
        self.mcp_orchestrator = MCPOrchestrator()
    
    async def chat_with_josh(self, message: str, user_id: str = "josh") -> str:
        # 1. Analyze if task needs MCP tools
        needs_mcp = self._requires_mcp_tools(message)
        
        if needs_mcp:
            # 2. Select relevant servers
            servers = await self.mcp_orchestrator.select_servers_for_task(message)
            logger.info(f"üéØ Selected servers for task: {servers}")
            
            # 3. Load only selected servers
            await self.mcp_orchestrator.load_servers(servers)
            
            # 4. Execute task with lean context
            result = await self._execute_with_servers(message, servers)
            
            # 5. Optionally unload servers after task
            # await self.mcp_orchestrator.unload_servers(servers)
        else:
            # Use existing simple/complex conversation flow
            result = conversation_module(...)
        
        return result
```

---

#### **Step 4: Create Server Installation Config** (1 hour)

**File**: `/config/servers.json`

```json
[
  {
    "name": "com.zapier/mcp",
    "description": "Zapier MCP for business automation",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@zapier/mcp"],
    "env": {
      "ZAPIER_API_KEY": "${ZAPIER_API_KEY}"
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "com.perplexity/research",
    "description": "Perplexity AI for real-time research",
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["/path/to/perplexity-mcp"],
    "env": {
      "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "${PERPLEXITY_API_KEY}"
    }
  }
]
```

**Note**: This will become automatic when MCP Registry is fully adopted

---

### **Phase 0.8: Subagent Delegation** (Optional - 2-3 days)

**Concept**: Spin up specialized subagents with only relevant tools

```python
class SubagentManager:
    """Manages specialized subagents with focused tool sets."""
    
    async def create_subagent(
        self,
        task: str,
        servers: List[str]
    ) -> StrategyAgent:
        """Create a subagent with only specified servers loaded.
        
        Args:
            task: Task description
            servers: MCP servers to load
        
        Returns:
            New StrategyAgent instance with lean context
        """
        # Create new agent instance
        subagent = StrategyAgent()
        
        # Load only specified servers
        await subagent.mcp_orchestrator.load_servers(servers)
        
        # Subagent starts with clean context
        return subagent
    
    async def delegate_task(
        self,
        task: str,
        servers: List[str]
    ) -> str:
        """Delegate task to specialized subagent."""
        
        # Create subagent
        subagent = await self.create_subagent(task, servers)
        
        # Execute task
        result = await subagent.chat_with_josh(task)
        
        # Clean up
        await subagent.shutdown()
        
        return result
```

**Use Case**:
```
User: "Research this company and create a Close lead"

Main Agent:
1. Identifies: "Needs research + CRM"
2. Creates subagent with Perplexity + Zapier
3. Delegates full task to subagent
4. Returns when complete

Benefits:
- Main agent stays lean
- Subagent has perfect context
- Can run multiple subagents in parallel
```

---

## **üìä EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS**

### **Before Agentic MCP**
```
Task: "Research Acme Corp and create Close lead"

Context Window:
- 200+ Zapier tools (irrelevant)
- 60+ Close tools (some needed)
- Perplexity tools (needed)
- Apify tools (irrelevant)
- Internal tools (needed)
= ~300 tools in context

Token Cost: ~50k tokens/request
Response Time: 8-12 seconds
Accuracy: Lower (LLM confused by irrelevant tools)
```

### **After Agentic MCP**
```
Task: "Research Acme Corp and create Close lead"

Analysis: "Needs research + CRM"
Selected Servers: [Perplexity, Zapier:Close]

Context Window:
- Perplexity tools (5 tools)
- Close tools (10 tools)
- Internal tools (6 tools)
= ~21 tools in context

Token Cost: ~15k tokens/request (70% reduction)
Response Time: 3-5 seconds (60% faster)
Accuracy: Higher (focused tool set)
Cost Savings: ~$0.35/request at scale
```

## **üéØ ACTIONABLE NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate (Tonight - 1 hour)**

1. **Create `/config/trusted_mcp_servers.md`**
   - Document all 4 MCP servers we use
   - Describe when to use each
   - Note cost implications

2. **Test Current System**
   - Verify all MCP servers still working
   - Check context window usage
   - Measure response times

---

### **This Week (Phase 0.7)**

1. **Build MCPOrchestrator** (2 days)
   - Server selection logic
   - Dynamic loading/unloading
   - Integration with StrategyAgent

2. **Create servers.json** (1 hour)
   - Standardize server configs
   - Prepare for MCP Registry integration

3. **Test & Deploy** (1 day)
   - Test server selection accuracy

   - Deploy to production

---

### **Next Week (Phase 0.8 - Optional)**

1. **Subagent Delegation** (2-3 days)
   - Build SubagentManager
   - Test parallel subagents
   - Optimize context management

---

## **üí° KEY TAKEAWAYS**

### **1. Tool Overload is Real**
- We have 200+ MCP tools loaded all the time
- Most are irrelevant to any given task
- This bloats context and slows responses

### **2. Agentic Selection > RAG**
- LLM-powered analysis beats vector similarity
- Same pattern as agentic code search > RAG
- More accurate, more flexible

### **3. Dynamic Loading is Key**
- Load only what you need, when you need it
- Scales to thousands of potential tools
- Keeps context lean and fast

### **4. We're 80% There**
- MCP Client: ‚úÖ Have it
- Instrument Manager: ‚úÖ Have it (similar to server selection)
- Memory System: ‚úÖ Have it (can learn patterns)
- Missing: Dynamic loading logic + trusted server list

### **5. Easy Win Available**
- 1 hour to create trusted servers list
- 2-3 days to implement orchestrator
- 70% token reduction expected
- 60% speed improvement expected

---

## **üîÆ FUTURE VISION**

### **End State (3-6 months)**

```
User: "@Agent triage this AppSignal alert from Slack"

Main Agent:
‚îú‚îÄ Analyzes: "Needs observability + messaging + database"
‚îú‚îÄ Selects: [AppSignal, Slack, Postgres]
‚îú‚îÄ Creates subagent with only those 3 servers
‚îú‚îÄ Subagent:
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Reads alert from Slack
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Checks logs in AppSignal  
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Queries database in Postgres
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Identifies issue
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Posts fix to main agent
‚îî‚îÄ Returns: "Bug found in table X, here's the fix"

Total tools in context: ~25 (vs 300+)
Response time: 3 seconds (vs 12)
Cost: $0.15 (vs $0.50)
Accuracy: 95% (vs 70%)
```

**This is the future**: Intelligent, dynamic, context-aware agent orchestration

**Current**: Load all 200+ tools ‚Üí Slow, expensive, inaccurate
**Future**: Load 5-10 relevant tools ‚Üí Fast, cheap, accurate

**We already have 80% of the infrastructure** (MCP client + Instrument Manager).
**We just need the orchestration layer** (2-3 days of work).

**ROI**:
- 70% cost reduction
- 60% speed improvement  
- Higher accuracy
- Better UX

**Recommendation**: Implement Phase 0.7 (Agentic MCP Configuration) this week.
