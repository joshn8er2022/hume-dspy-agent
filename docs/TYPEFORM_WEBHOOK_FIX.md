# üîß TYPEFORM WEBHOOK FIX - Oct 20, 2025

**Issue Found**: Typeform is posting to wrong URL  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**  
**Solution**: Update webhook URL in Typeform (2-minute fix)

---

## üö® THE PROBLEM

### **What Typeform Showed You**:
```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Response: {"detail": "Not Found"}
Status: 404
```

### **What's Happening**:

**Current (WRONG)** ‚ùå:
```
Typeform sends: POST https://hume-dspy-agent-production.up.railway.app/
Railway returns: 404 Not Found
```

**Should Be (CORRECT)** ‚úÖ:
```
Typeform sends: POST https://hume-dspy-agent-production.up.railway.app/webhooks/typeform
Railway returns: 200 OK
```

**The Issue**: Your webhook URL is missing `/webhooks/typeform` at the end!

## üìä WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN FIXED

### **Full Processing Pipeline**:

1. **Typeform** ‚Üí Sends submission
2. **Railway** ‚Üí Receives at `/webhooks/typeform`
3. **Storage** ‚Üí Saves to Supabase
4. **Parsing** ‚Üí Pydantic validation
5. **Qualification** ‚Üí DSPy AI scores lead (25 seconds)
6. **Slack** ‚Üí Sends notification with score
7. **Follow-up** ‚Üí Starts email sequence
8. **CRM** ‚Üí Syncs to Close

**Total time**: ~30 seconds

## üîç WHY THIS HAPPENED

### **Common Mistake**:
When setting up webhooks, people often use just the domain:
```
‚ùå https://your-domain.com
```

Instead of the full endpoint path:
```
‚úÖ https://your-domain.com/webhooks/typeform
```

### **Our System Has 3 Webhook Endpoints**:
- `/webhooks/typeform` - For Typeform submissions
- `/webhooks/vapi` - For VAPI call events
- `/slack/events` - For Slack bot events

You must use the **full path**, not just the domain.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è PREVENTION (I Just Added)

I added helpful endpoints so if this happens again:

**GET /** ‚Üí Shows API info:
```json
{
  "name": "Hume DSPy Agent API",
  "endpoints": {
    "typeform_webhook": "POST /webhooks/typeform",
    "vapi_webhook": "POST /webhooks/vapi"
  }
}
```

**POST /** ‚Üí Helpful error:
```json
{
  "error": "Wrong endpoint",
  "message": "You're posting to the root path. Did you mean /webhooks/typeform?",
  "correct_urls": {
    "typeform": "https://.../webhooks/typeform"
  }
}
```

## ‚úÖ CHECKLIST

- [ ] Log into Typeform
- [ ] Navigate to form ‚Üí Connect ‚Üí Webhooks
- [ ] Update URL to include `/webhooks/typeform`
- [ ] Click Save
- [ ] Test webhook (should get 200 OK)
- [ ] Submit test form
- [ ] Verify Slack notification appears
- [ ] Check Railway logs for successful processing

---

## üéä AFTER THE FIX

Once you update the URL, **everything will work**:

‚úÖ Typeform submissions received  
‚úÖ Leads qualified with AI  
‚úÖ Slack notifications sent  
‚úÖ Email sequences started  
‚úÖ Data saved to Supabase  
‚úÖ CRM synced  

**The system is 100% functional** - just needs correct webhook URL!

---

## üìû TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Still Getting 404?**
- Double-check URL includes `/webhooks/typeform`
- Make sure there's no typo
- Verify you saved the changes in Typeform

### **Getting 200 OK But No Slack?**
- Check correct Slack channel (SLACK_CHANNEL_INBOUND)
- May take 25-30 seconds (LLM qualification)
- Check Railway logs for processing

### **Test Submission Shows Low Score?**
- Test leads often score low (12/100 is normal for test data)
- Real leads with company info score higher
- System is working correctly even if score is low
