# 🔍 Current State Analysis - October 18, 2025 11:06 PM

**Status**: Phoenix partially working, Database blocked, Agents initialized

---

## **📊 What's Working** ✅

### **1. Phoenix Observability Initialized**
```
✅ Phoenix tracing initialized
   Project: hume-dspy-agent
   Endpoint: https://app.phoenix.arize.com/s/buildoutinc/v1/traces
   Dashboard: https://app.phoenix.arize.com/
✅ DSPy instrumentation enabled
   All DSPy calls will be traced in Phoenix
```

**User reported**: "Things came in to Phoenix"

**This means**:
- Phoenix SDK initialized correctly
- DSPy instrumentation is active
- SOME traces are reaching Phoenix
- BUT: Getting 401 errors on export (see issues below)

---

### **2. All Agents Initialized**
```
✅ Strategy Agent initialized
   - Supabase: ✅ Connected
   - Audit Agent: ✅ Initialized
   - A2A: ✅ Configured
✅ Follow-Up Agent: Using Sonnet 4.5
✅ Research Agent: Initialized
✅ Inbound Agent: Ready
```

---

### **3. DSPy Configuration**
```
✅ DSPy configured globally with Claude Haiku 4.5 via OpenRouter
   Low-tier: claude-haiku-4.5 (default)
   High-tier: claude-sonnet-4.5 (complex reasoning)
```

---

## **🚨 Critical Issues** ❌

### **Issue 1: Phoenix Token Invalid (401 Errors)**

**Logs show**:
```
ERROR - Failed to export span batch code: 401, reason: Invalid token
```

**Happening repeatedly**: Every time a trace is generated

**Why this is confusing**:
- User said "things came in to Phoenix" ✅
- But logs show 401 errors ❌

**Possible explanations**:
1. **Partial API key**: User provided `Hume_obser_-_-_API` which might be truncated
2. **Wrong key type**: Might be using project key instead of system API key
3. **Key not fully deployed**: Railway might not have picked up the new variable yet
4. **Old traces showing**: Phoenix might show old traces before key was added

**What to check**:
1. Go to Phoenix → Settings → API Keys
2. Verify the FULL API key (it's usually much longer)
3. Make sure it's a **System API Key** not a project key
4. Re-add to Railway with complete key

---

### **Issue 2: Database Schema Broken** 🔴 **BLOCKING**

**Logs show**:
```
ERROR - column leads.tier does not exist
```

**Impact**:
- ❌ Audit can't query lead data
- ❌ Can't show real lead names/emails
- ❌ Can't provide tier distribution
- ❌ All database queries fail

**Why this is blocking everything**:
The `tier` column is used by:
- AuditAgent to query leads by tier
- Strategy Agent to build pipeline context
- Follow-Up Agent to determine email cadence

**Fix required** (SQL in Supabase):
```sql
ALTER TABLE leads ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tier TEXT;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_leads_tier ON leads(tier);
UPDATE leads SET tier = 'UNQUALIFIED' WHERE tier IS NULL;
```

**File**: `migrations/001_add_tier_column.sql`

---

### **Issue 3: Fake CLI Menus (Partially Fixed)**

**Status**: Deployed fix, awaiting test

**What we fixed**:
- Added FORBIDDEN rules to DSPy signature
- Agent should now admit when it can't do something
- Should NOT generate fake command menus anymore

**Need to verify**: Test with "call inbound agent" after deployment

---

## **🔭 Phoenix Instrumentation Analysis**

### **What We Have Installed**

**Current instrumentation** (from code):
```python
from phoenix.otel import register
from openinference.instrumentation.dspy import DSPyInstrumentor

# Initialize Phoenix
tracer_provider = register(
    project_name="hume-dspy-agent",
    endpoint="https://app.phoenix.arize.com/s/buildoutinc/v1/traces",
    auto_instrument=True
)

# Instrument DSPy
DSPyInstrumentor().instrument()
```

**This traces**:
- ✅ All DSPy calls (ChainOfThought, ReAct, etc.)
- ✅ All LLM calls (Claude via OpenRouter)
- ✅ Prompts sent
- ✅ Responses received
- ✅ Token counts
- ✅ Latency

---

### **What's NOT Traced (Yet)**

Based on Phoenix documentation options:

**Available but not installed**:
- ❌ **OpenAI** - Not needed (using Anthropic)
- ❌ **LlamaIndex** - Not using
- ❌ **LangChain** - We have it but not instrumenting
- ❌ **Anthropic** - Could add direct Anthropic instrumentation
- ❌ **Bedrock** - Not using
- ❌ **Groq** - Not using
- ❌ **CrewAI** - Not using
- ❌ **Pydantic AI** - Not using

**What we SHOULD add**:

1. **LangChain Instrumentation** (We use LangGraph!)
   ```bash
   pip install openinference-instrumentation-langchain
   ```
   ```python
   from openinference.instrumentation.langchain import LangChainInstrumentor
   LangChainInstrumentor().instrument()
   ```
   **Why**: Follow-Up Agent uses LangGraph workflows

2. **Anthropic Instrumentation** (Optional, DSPy already traces it)
   ```bash
   pip install openinference-instrumentation-anthropic
   ```
   **Why**: Direct visibility into Claude API calls

---

### **Current Trace Coverage**

**What Phoenix sees right now**:

```
✅ DSPy Conversations
   └─ Strategy Agent responses
      ├─ Prompt formatting
      ├─ LLM call (Claude Haiku/Sonnet)
      │  ├─ Input tokens
      │  ├─ Output tokens
      │  ├─ Latency
      │  └─ Cost
      └─ Response parsing

✅ Audit Queries (when database works)
   └─ AuditAgent.audit_lead_flow()
      ├─ Supabase query attempt
      └─ GMass API call attempt

❌ LangGraph Workflows (NOT traced yet)
   └─ Follow-Up Agent lead journeys
      └─ All state transitions invisible

❌ Custom Operations (NOT traced)
   └─ Slack API calls
   └─ GMass API calls
   └─ Database queries
```

## **📋 What Needs To Be Done**

### **Immediate (Do Now)**

#### **1. Fix Phoenix API Key** 🔴 **URGENT**
**Problem**: 401 errors on every trace export

**Action**:
1. Go to Phoenix → Settings → API Keys
2. Get FULL system API key (likely much longer than `Hume_obser_-_-_API`)
3. Add to Railway: `PHOENIX_API_KEY=<full_key_here>`
4. Verify no more 401 errors in logs

**How to verify**:
```bash
# After adding key, check logs
railway logs

# Should see NO MORE:
# ERROR - Failed to export span batch code: 401
```

---

#### **2. Fix Database Schema** 🔴 **BLOCKING EVERYTHING**
**Problem**: `column leads.tier does not exist`

**Action**:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. SQL Editor → New Query
3. Copy/paste from `migrations/001_add_tier_column.sql`:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE leads ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tier TEXT;
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_leads_tier ON leads(tier);
   UPDATE leads SET tier = 'UNQUALIFIED' WHERE tier IS NULL;
   ```
4. Click Run
5. Verify: `SELECT tier FROM leads LIMIT 1;`

**How to verify**:
```bash
# After fixing, send in Slack: "audit our lead flow"
# Should see real lead data, NOT:
# ERROR - column leads.tier does not exist
```

---

#### **3. Test Fake Menu Fix** 🟡
**Action**: Send in Slack after deployment:
- "call inbound agent"
- "query the follow-up agent"

**Expected**:
- ❌ Should NOT show fake command menus
- ✅ Should say "I can't do that yet" or execute real action

---

### **Short Term (This Week)**

#### **4. Add LangChain Instrumentation** 📊
**Why**: Follow-Up Agent uses LangGraph, not traced yet

**Action**:
```bash
# Add to requirements.txt
openinference-instrumentation-langchain>=0.1.0

# Add to core/observability.py
from openinference.instrumentation.langchain import LangChainInstrumentor
LangChainInstrumentor().instrument()
```

**Impact**: See Follow-Up Agent workflow transitions in Phoenix

---

#### **5. Implement Follow-Up Scheduling** ⏰
**Why**: Currently only sends initial email, no follow-ups

**Action**:
1. Add timestamp columns to database (SQL ready)
2. Create cron endpoint `/cron/process-follow-ups`
3. Set up Railway cron job (every 6 hours)

**Files**: `docs/FOLLOW_UP_SCHEDULING_TODO.md`

---

#### **6. Implement Real A2A Communication** 🤖
**Why**: Agents don't actually call each other yet

**Action**:
1. Create A2A protocol in `agents/a2a_protocol.py`
2. Allow Strategy Agent to call other agents
3. Return real results, not fake menus

---

### **Long Term (Next Week+)**

#### **7. Add Custom Tracing for Non-LLM Calls** 📊
**Why**: Slack, GMass, Supabase calls not visible

**Action**:
```python
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

@tracer.start_as_current_span("slack_api_call")
def post_message(channel, text):
    # Slack API call
    pass
```

**Impact**: Complete visibility into all operations

---

#### **8. Email Response Detection** 📧
**Why**: Don't know when leads reply

**Options**:
1. Gmail API webhook
2. GMass webhook
3. Periodic polling

---

#### **9. MCP Integration** 🔌
**Why**: Get 100+ instant integrations

**Impact**: GitHub, Calendar, Drive, etc.

---

## **🔬 Deep Dive: Is Phoenix Actually Working?**

### **Evidence Phoenix IS Working**:
1. ✅ User said "things came in to Phoenix"
2. ✅ Initialization logs show success
3. ✅ DSPy instrumentation enabled
4. ✅ Project appears in dashboard

### **Evidence Phoenix Has Issues**:
1. ❌ 401 errors on every export
2. ❌ API key likely incomplete

### **Diagnosis**:

**Most likely scenario**:
- Phoenix received INITIAL traces (before 401 errors started)
- Those showed up in dashboard
- User saw them and confirmed "things came in"
- BUT subsequent traces failing due to invalid token
- Need to fix API key to see ALL traces

**How to verify**:
1. Fix API key (get full key from Phoenix)
2. Send test message in Slack
3. Check Phoenix dashboard for NEW trace
4. Should see complete trace with no errors

---

## **📝 Instrumentation Recommendations**

### **Current Setup** (Good)
```python
✅ Phoenix OTEL SDK
✅ DSPy Instrumentation
✅ OpenTelemetry API/SDK
```

### **Should Add** (High Priority)
```python
🟡 LangChain Instrumentation
   Why: Follow-Up Agent uses LangGraph
   Impact: See workflow state transitions
```

### **Optional But Nice**
```python
⚪ Anthropic Instrumentation
   Why: Direct Claude visibility
   Impact: Redundant with DSPy but more detail

⚪ Custom Spans
   Why: Trace Slack/GMass/Supabase calls
   Impact: Complete visibility
```

### **Don't Need**
```python
❌ OpenAI - Not using
❌ LlamaIndex - Not using
❌ Bedrock - Not using
❌ Groq - Not using
❌ CrewAI - Not using
```
