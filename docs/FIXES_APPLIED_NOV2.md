# Fixes Applied - November 2, 2025

## Critical Fixes

### ✅ 1. Fixed Asyncio Scope Issues

**Problem:**
- `FollowUpAgent.respond()`: `name 'asyncio' is not defined`
- `InboundAgent.qualify_lead()`: `cannot access local variable 'asyncio'`

**Root Cause:**
Even though `asyncio` was imported at the module level, Python's scope resolution was having issues when `asyncio` was used inside exception handlers or nested try/except blocks. This can happen when Python thinks `asyncio` might be assigned locally somewhere.

**Solution:**
Added explicit `import asyncio` statements inside the methods where it's used:
- `FollowUpAgent.respond()`: Added import at method start
- `InboundAgent.qualify_lead()`: Added imports in both try and except blocks for memory save
- `InboundAgent.qualify_lead()`: Added imports in both try and except blocks for ABM campaign

**Files Changed:**
- `agents/follow_up_agent.py` (line 523)
- `agents/inbound_agent.py` (lines 268, 275, 302, 312)

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ FollowUpAgent can now execute properly
- ✅ InboundAgent memory saves will work
- ✅ No more "asyncio not defined" errors

---

### ✅ 2. Updated Slack Channel to `ai-test`

**Problem:**
- Slack notifications failing with `channel_not_found` error
- Channel was defaulting to `inbound-leads` or old channel ID

**Solution:**
Updated all Slack channel references to use `ai-test`:
- `StrategyAgent.process_lead_webhook()`: Now uses `ai-test` (or `SLACK_CHANNEL_AI_TEST` env var)
- `FollowUpAgent.start_lead_journey()`: Default changed to `ai-test`
- `FollowUpAgent.respond()`: Default changed to `ai-test`

**Files Changed:**
- `agents/strategy_agent.py` (line 2649)
- `agents/follow_up_agent.py` (lines 439, 583)

**Note:**
The channel name `ai-test` will be automatically resolved to a channel ID using the `get_channel_id()` helper function in `utils/slack_helpers.py`. This requires:
- Bot token is configured
- Bot is invited to the `ai-test` channel
- Channel name resolution succeeds

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Slack notifications should now post to `ai-test` channel
- ✅ Channel name will resolve to ID automatically
- ✅ No more `channel_not_found` errors (assuming bot is in channel)

## Issues Still Remaining (Non-Critical)

### ⚠️ PostgreSQL IPv6 Connection Failures

**Error:**
```
WARNING - error connecting in 'pool-4': connection is bad: connection to server at "2600:1f16:1cd0:332a:dfa1:5e11:e577:96ea", port 5432 failed: Network is unreachable
```

**Impact:**
- FollowUpAgent checkpointer falls back to in-memory (non-persistent)
- System still functions, but state isn't persisted across restarts

**Status:** Non-critical, fallback works

**Fix Needed:** Configure PostgreSQL connection string to use IPv4 or fix network routing in Railway

---

### ⚠️ Duplicate Key Errors

**Error:**
```
ERROR - ❌ Failed to save lead to database: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "leads_typeform_id_key"
```

**Impact:**
- Happens when same webhook is processed twice
- Lead already exists, so this is mostly harmless
- Indicates duplicate webhook processing

**Status:** Non-critical, should add idempotency check

**Fix Needed:** Add check for existing lead before attempting insert

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] FollowUpAgent executes without asyncio errors
- [ ] InboundAgent memory saves complete successfully
- [ ] Slack notifications appear in `ai-test` channel
- [ ] No `channel_not_found` errors in logs
- [ ] Lead processing completes end-to-end
- [ ] Qualification, research, and follow-up all execute

---

## Deployment Notes

These fixes should be deployed immediately as they resolve critical errors that prevent:
1. FollowUpAgent from executing
2. Memory saves from completing
3. Slack notifications from being sent

**Commit:** Ready for push to Railway
