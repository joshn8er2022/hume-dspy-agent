## ‚úÖ VERIFIED CONNECTION

### How to Verify Service is Linked
```bash
railway status
# Should show:
# Service: hume-dspy-agent

### How to Access Variables
```bash
railway variables
# Works directly - no need to link service separately
```

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "No service linked" Error

**Symptoms:**
```
No service linked
Run `railway service` to link a service
```

**Root Cause:**
- Service was actually already linked
- Railway CLI sometimes doesn't detect it correctly

**Solution:**
1. Check current status: `railway status`
2. If it shows `Service: hume-dspy-agent`, service IS linked
3. Try `railway variables` directly - it should work

**Key Insight:**
- Service linking happens automatically when project is linked
- The service name `hume-dspy-agent` is the correct identifier
- No manual `railway service` command needed if project is linked
