## 🧪 **TESTING CHECKLIST**

### **Test 1: Simple File List** (Primary Test)

**Wait**: 2-3 minutes for Railway deployment  
**Then Open**: Slack → Hume channel

**Command**:
```
List all files in my Google Drive
```

**✅ SUCCESS Looks Like**:
```
I found 131 files in your Google Drive:

...

Would you like me to organize these by category or search for specific files?
```

**❌ FAILURE Looks Like**:
```

1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Select: hume-dspy-agent project
3. Click: Deployments tab
4. Watch: Latest deployment building
```

**Build Steps**:

## 📊 **LOGS TO CHECK**

### **If Test Fails, Check These**:

**Railway Logs** → Look for:
```bash
# Good signs ✅
"MCP client initialized successfully"
"Loaded Zapier MCP with 243 tools"
"Strategy Agent ready"

# Bad signs ❌
"Failed to load MCP server: zapier"
"Tool not found: google_drive_retrieve_files_from_google_drive"
"MCP connection error"
```

**Phoenix Dashboard** → Check:
```
1. Go to Phoenix UI
2. Find latest trace for "List all files"
3. Check tool calls
4. Look for: google_drive_retrieve_files_from_google_drive in trace
```

---

## ⚙️ **IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG**

### **Issue 1: MCP Not Loading**

**Symptom**: "MCP server zapier not found"

**Fix**:
```bash
# Check Railway environment variables
ZAPIER_NLA_API_KEY=xxx  # Must be set
```

### **Issue 2: Tool Still Not Found**

**Symptom**: "Tool google_drive_retrieve_files_from_google_drive not found"

**Debug**:
```
In Slack, ask agent:
"List all available MCP tools"

Should see:
- google_drive_retrieve_files_from_google_drive ✅
- google_drive_find_a_file ✅
- google_sheets_get_rows ✅
... (243 total)
```

### **Issue 3: Deployment Failed**

**Check**:
1. Railway build logs for errors
2. Check if requirements.txt has all deps
3. Verify Python version (should be 3.13)

---

## 🎯 **AFTER SUCCESSFUL TEST**

### **Next Steps**:

1. ✅ **Celebrate** - This was blocking KB implementation!

2. **Tomorrow Morning**:
   - Implement RAG pipeline (2-3 hours)
   - Extract first 10 high-priority files
   - Test agent queries from KB

3. **This Week**:
   - Complete KB extraction (42 files)
   - Deploy RAG pipeline as background worker
   - Implement FAISS vector memory
