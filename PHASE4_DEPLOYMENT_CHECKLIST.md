## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Environment Variables (Railway)

**CRITICAL**: Verify these are set in Railway before deploying:

```bash
# Required
SUPABASE_URL=<your_url>
SUPABASE_KEY=<your_key>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_key>

# Recommended (for full ABM functionality)
APOLLO_API_KEY=<your_key>
CLEARBIT_API_KEY=<your_key>
GMASS_API_KEY=<your_key>
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=<your_sid>
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=<your_token>
```

**Verify in Railway**:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your service
3. Click "Variables" tab
4. Confirm all required variables are set

### Step 2: Database Schema (Supabase)

**CRITICAL**: Verify these tables exist:

```sql
-- Check tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('companies', 'contacts', 'relationships', 'campaigns', 'touchpoints', 'accounts');
```

**Expected**: All 6 tables should exist (created in Phase 2-3)

### Step 3: Git Commit & Push

```bash
cd /root/hume-dspy-agent

# Stage all changes
git add agents/inbound_agent.py
git add agents/follow_up_agent.py
git add models/qualification.py
git add tests/test_e2e_abm.py
git add docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
git add docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
git add PHASE4_COMPLETION.md
git add PHASE4_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md

# Commit
git commit -m "Phase 4: ABM Integration - Production Ready

Files Modified:
- agents/inbound_agent.py (+1,633 bytes)
- agents/follow_up_agent.py (+1,407 bytes)
- models/qualification.py (+1 line)

Files Added:
- tests/test_e2e_abm.py (10 tests)
- docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
- docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md

"

# Push to trigger Railway auto-deploy
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment

```bash
# Watch Railway deployment
railway logs --follow

# Look for:
# âœ… Build successful
# âœ… Dependencies installed
# âœ… Application started
# âœ… No import errors
# âœ… Health check passed
```

### Step 5: Smoke Test

**Test 1: Submit Test Lead**

Submit via Typeform with:
- Company: "Test Healthcare Inc"
- Email: "test@testhealthcare.com"
- Business Size: "50-200 employees"
- Patient Volume: "1000+ patients"

**Expected Logs**:
```
ðŸ’¾ Saved lead to memory: test@testhealthcare.com
ðŸŽ¯ ABM Campaign initiated: campaign-abc123 for test@testhealthcare.com (tier: hot)
```

**Test 2: Verify Database**

```sql
-- Check campaign created
SELECT * FROM campaigns 
WHERE primary_contact_email = 'test@testhealthcare.com' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Check account created
SELECT * FROM accounts 
WHERE company_name = 'Test Healthcare Inc';
```

**Test 3: Verify Slack Notification**

Check Slack channel for qualification notification.

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### First 24 Hours

**Monitor**:
- [ ] No critical errors in logs
- [ ] ABM campaigns being initiated
- [ ] Campaign IDs being stored
- [ ] Database writes successful
- [ ] No performance degradation

**Key Metrics**:
- Campaign initiation rate: Should be 60-80% of qualified leads
- Error rate: Should be < 5%
- Response time: Should be < 2s for qualification

### First Week

**Monitor**:
- [ ] Colleague research working
- [ ] Multi-contact emails being sent
- [ ] "Sue, your colleague..." messages sent
- [ ] Response tracking accurate
- [ ] No unexpected errors

**Key Metrics**:
- Colleague discovery rate: Should be > 50% of companies
- Multi-contact engagement: Track response rates
- Campaign completion rate: Track won/lost ratio

---

## Rollback Procedure

### If Critical Issues Detected

```bash
# Option 1: Git revert
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Option 2: Restore from backups
cp agents/inbound_agent.py.backup_phase4 agents/inbound_agent.py
cp agents/follow_up_agent.py.backup_phase4 agents/follow_up_agent.py
cp models/qualification.py.backup_phase4 models/qualification.py
git commit -am "Rollback Phase 4 integration"
git push origin main
```

### Partial Rollback (Disable ABM Only)

If you want to keep the code but disable ABM:

```python
# In agents/inbound_agent.py, line ~165
# Comment out the ABM campaign initiation:

# ABM CAMPAIGN: Initiate multi-contact campaign for qualified leads
campaign_id = None
if False:  # DISABLED - change to True to re-enable
    if is_qualified and tier in [LeadTier.SCORCHING, LeadTier.HOT, LeadTier.WARM]:
        # ... ABM code ...
```
