# 🌟 HUME BOT - NORTH STAR ROADMAP

**Vision**: Full-Stack Autonomous Business Development Engine  
**Updated**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 1.0 Active (15% complete)

---

## 🎯 WHERE WE'RE GOING

A self-evolving AI system that:
- ✅ Captures leads across all channels (inbound)
- ✅ Qualifies intelligently with DSPy
- ✅ Executes multi-channel outbound (email, SMS, LinkedIn, calls, letters)
- ✅ Generates sales content automatically (videos, images, copy)
- ✅ Makes cost-benefit decisions (when to send free units, make calls, etc.)
- ✅ Coordinates account-based marketing (multi-person targeting)
- ✅ Self-optimizes through data
- ✅ **Creates new agents as needs emerge** (meta-agentic)

---

## 💰 WHY THIS WORKS

**Unit Economics**:
- Cost: $35/unit
- Retail: $229-290/unit
- **Margin: 85% (~$200/unit)**

**This means**:
- Spending $105 (3 free units) to land a $50K enterprise deal = **2,100% ROI**
- Aggressive personalization is economically justified
- Automation scales profitably with zero marginal cost

**Current Capacity**:
- 35 email inboxes × 35/day = **1,225 emails/day**
- 5-6 LinkedIn accounts (enterprise)
- VAPI autonomous calling
- SMS (activating next)

## 🎯 ACCOUNT-BASED MARKETING (ABM) VISION

### Current: Individual Outreach
- Research 1 person
- 1 channel
- Generic follow-up

### Target: Account-Level Orchestration

**Example - Hospital Target**:
| Contact | Role | Channel | Message |
|---------|------|---------|---------|
| Purchasing Manager | Decision-maker | Email | ROI data |
| Head of Aesthetics | User | LinkedIn | Clinical benefits |
| Front Desk Staff | Influencer | Physical | Free unit |
| CFO Assistant | Gatekeeper | VAPI Call | Demo scheduling |
| CEO | Authority | Letter | Case study |

**Result**: Multi-person, multi-channel, coordinated campaign

---

## 🧠 COST-BENEFIT ENGINE

### Decision Framework

```python
expected_value = deal_size × conversion_probability
roi = (expected_value - cost) / cost

# Example:
# Deal: $50,000
# Conversion: 20% (based on profile)
# Expected value: $10,000
# Cost: $105 (3 free units)
# ROI: 9,423% → SEND UNITS!
```

**Channels by Cost**:
- Email: $0
- SMS: $0.01
- Call (VAPI): $0.50
- LinkedIn: $0
- Free Unit: $35
- Letter: $5

**System optimizes**: Which channels, in what order, for maximum ROI

---

## 🤖 META-AGENTIC CAPABILITY

### Self-Evolution Process

```
1. Strategy Agent identifies gap
   "Enterprise ABM conversion too low"

2. Strategy Agent → Cascade
   "@Cascade build ABM Agent for multi-person targeting"

3. Co-creation
   - Design API together
   - Generate code (Claude/GPT-4)
   - Write tests
   - Deploy to Railway

4. Monitor performance
   - Track for 1 week
   - Measure conversion lift
   - Calculate ROI

5. Iterate
   - Enhance based on data
   - Scale what works
   - Deprecate what doesn't
```

**Result**: System that improves itself autonomously
