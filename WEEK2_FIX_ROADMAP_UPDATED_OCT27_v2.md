# 🔧 WEEK 2 FIX ROADMAP - UPDATED WITH TWO-TIER ARCHITECTURE

**Created**: October 26, 2025, 1:57 AM MT
**Updated**: October 27, 2025, 07:01 AM PT
**Timeline**: Oct 26 - Nov 8, 2025 (2 weeks)
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Day 1 Complete, Day 2 Starting
**Progress**: 40% complete (28/71 hours)

## 🎯 CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DECISION (Oct 27, 12:00 AM PT)

### **Two-Tier Delegation Model** ✅ APPROVED

**Tier 1: Strategic Partnership (A2A)**
- StrategyAgent ↔ Agent Zero
- For: Long-running implementation tasks (code fixes, deployments)
- Protocol: A2A (JSON-RPC 2.0, task-based)
- Why: Perfect for complex, stateful operations

**Tier 2: Specialist Delegation (HTTP/REST)**
- StrategyAgent → InboundAgent, ResearchAgent, FollowUpAgent
- For: Fast, synchronous operations (qualification, research, execution)
- Protocol: Direct HTTP/REST
- Why: Simple, fast, reliable

**Key Insight**: Use the RIGHT protocol for each delegation type!

## ✅ DAY 1 ACHIEVEMENTS (Oct 26)

### **Phase 0: Critical Infrastructure** ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Railway deployment fixed (4 attempts, 3 syntax errors)
- ✅ Autonomous scheduler integrated and RUNNING
- ✅ Slack notifications fixed (channel_id bug)
- ✅ InboundAgent qualification fixed (PRIMARY_MODEL)
- ✅ StrategyAgent stability improved (optional field + 8000 tokens)

### **Phase 1: Autonomous Execution** ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Scheduler integrated into main.py
- ✅ Hourly follow-up checks configured
- ✅ 30-minute monitoring configured
- ✅ State persistence implemented
- ✅ **VERIFIED RUNNING** (logs show "Autonomous scheduler started")

### **Bonus Achievements**:
- ✅ YouTube video analysis (5 videos, 23 strategies, memory ID: WWcZQgbWzo)
- ✅ StrategyAgent-centric architecture designed (memory ID: YUQwUoBsWb)
- ✅ A2A protocol research completed (found implementation was wrong)
- ✅ Two-tier architecture proposal approved
- ✅ EngagementStrategy model created
- ✅ StrategyAgent webhook handler methods added (8 methods)

**Total**: 28 hours actual vs. 8 hours planned (3.5x over due to debugging + architecture)

- ⏳ Test delegation locally

#### 1.2 Add Feature Flag Routing (1 hour)
- ⏳ Add USE_STRATEGY_AGENT_ENTRY flag to main.py
- ⏳ Route webhook based on flag
- ⏳ Add logging for routing decisions
- ⏳ Test with flag OFF (default)

#### 1.3 Deploy and Test (1 hour)
- ⏳ Commit changes
- ⏳ Deploy to Railway (flag OFF)
- ⏳ Verify deployment successful
- ⏳ Test with single lead (flag ON)

#### 1.4 Gradual Rollout (1 hour)
- ⏳ Enable for 10% traffic
- ⏳ Monitor for 30 minutes
- ⏳ Increase to 50% if successful

---

### **Priority 2: Implement A2A for Agent Zero** (4 hours - Tomorrow)
**Status**: NOT STARTED

**Tasks**:

#### 2.1 Add A2A Endpoint to Agent Zero (2 hours)
- Create /a2a endpoint (JSON-RPC 2.0)
- Implement message/send, tasks/get, tasks/cancel

## 📈 EXPECTED OUTCOMES

**After Two-Tier Implementation**:

**Specialist Delegation** (HTTP/REST):
- ✅ Fast (3-30 seconds)
- ✅ Reliable (simple HTTP)
- ✅ Observable (Phoenix traces)
- ✅ Maintainable (standard REST)

**Agent Zero Partnership** (A2A):
- ✅ Complex tasks (code fixes, deployments)
- ✅ Long-running (minutes to hours)
- ✅ Stateful (can pause/resume)
- ✅ Monitorable (task status polling)

**Combined Impact**:
- 🚀 10x faster specialist delegation
- 🚀 Autonomous code fixes via Agent Zero
- 🚀 True self-healing system
- 🚀 Strategic intelligence + implementation muscle
