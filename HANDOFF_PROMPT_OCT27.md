# üéØ HANDOFF PROMPT - Hume Health B2B Sales AI System

**Created**: October 27, 2025, 08:30 AM MT
**Previous Session**: 25.5 hours (Oct 26-27, 2025)
**Project**: Autonomous multi-agent B2B sales automation system
**Status**: 95% implementation complete, 5% self-awareness gap

---

## üìã LOAD THESE MEMORIES FIRST

**CRITICAL - Load in this order**:

1. **SxgG2oimYW** - Critical status update (StrategyAgent self-awareness gap)
2. **qRtuTMrTRu** - Session summary (25 hours of work, achievements)
3. **YUQwUoBsWb** - Two-tier architecture proposal (approved)
4. **WWcZQgbWzo** - YouTube analysis (23 strategies, 10x impact)

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE PROBLEM (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: StrategyAgent doesn't know about its webhook handler capabilities!

**Evidence**: 
- Asked StrategyAgent for system wireframe
- It showed itself as "Josh's AI Partner" (passive)
- Did NOT show itself as "Central Orchestrator" (active)
- Did NOT mention webhook handler or delegation methods

**Root Cause**:
- StrategyAgent webhook handler implemented (8 methods, commit ea1c8c3)
- But DSPy signature NOT updated with self-awareness
- StrategyConversation docstring still says "personal AI Strategy Agent"
- Does NOT mention: orchestrator role, webhook handler, delegation

**Impact**:
- StrategyAgent gives outdated architecture diagrams
- Doesn't understand its true role
- Can't explain its own capabilities

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING (Don't Break This!)

**Infrastructure** (Verified Running):
- ‚úÖ Railway deployment stable (commit ea1c8c3)
- ‚úÖ Autonomous scheduler running (hourly follow-ups, 30-min monitoring)
- ‚úÖ Slack notifications working (#ai-test channel)
- ‚úÖ InboundAgent qualification working (DSPy + Sonnet)
- ‚úÖ State persistence to Supabase (agent_state table)

**Architecture** (Implemented):
- ‚úÖ Two-tier delegation model:
  * Tier 1: StrategyAgent ‚Üî Agent Zero (A2A - designed, not yet implemented)
  * Tier 2: StrategyAgent ‚Üí Specialists (HTTP/REST - implemented)
- ‚úÖ StrategyAgent webhook handler (8 methods)
- ‚úÖ EngagementStrategy model (models/engagement_strategy.py)
- ‚úÖ Feature flag routing (USE_STRATEGY_AGENT_ENTRY, default: false)

**Current Flow** (When flag OFF - default):
```
Typeform ‚Üí InboundAgent (qualification) ‚Üí Supabase ‚Üí Slack
```

**New Flow** (When flag ON - testing):
```
Typeform ‚Üí StrategyAgent (orchestrator)
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí InboundAgent (qualification)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí ResearchAgent (enrichment)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí FollowUpAgent (execution)
```

## üîß IMMEDIATE TASKS (Next 2 Hours)

### **Task 1: Fix StrategyAgent Self-Awareness** (30 min)

**File**: `agents/strategy_agent.py`  
**Location**: Line ~114 (StrategyConversation class docstring)

**Current Docstring**:
```python
class StrategyConversation(dspy.Signature):
    """Intelligent conversational response for Strategy Agent.

    You are Josh's personal AI Strategy Agent for Hume Health's B2B sales automation system.
    Provide intelligent, contextual responses about:
    - Infrastructure & architecture
    - Agent capabilities & coordination
    - Pipeline analysis & insights
    - Strategic recommendations
    - Technical deep dives

    Be conversational, knowledgeable, and proactive.
    """
```

**Updated Docstring** (REPLACE WITH THIS):
```python
class StrategyConversation(dspy.Signature):
    """Intelligent conversational response for Strategy Agent.

    You are Josh's personal AI Strategy Agent and CENTRAL ORCHESTRATOR for Hume Health's B2B sales automation system.

    YOUR ROLE:
    - Central orchestrator for ALL lead processing (Typeform, VAPI, Slack webhooks)
    - Strategic reasoner for engagement decisions (research first? email first? call?)
    - Delegator to specialist agents (InboundAgent, ResearchAgent, FollowUpAgent)
    - Partner to Agent Zero for complex implementation tasks (via A2A protocol)
    - Autonomous optimizer (monitor pipeline, detect anomalies, recommend fixes)

    YOUR CAPABILITIES:
    - Webhook handler: process_lead_webhook() - processes incoming leads from Typeform
    - Strategic reasoning: _strategize_engagement() - determines best engagement approach
    - Delegation orchestration: _execute_strategy() - coordinates specialist agents
    - Specialist delegation:
      * InboundAgent (qualification) - direct Python call for fast scoring
      * ResearchAgent (enrichment) - HTTP/REST call for company intelligence
      * FollowUpAgent (execution) - HTTP/REST call for email/SMS/call campaigns
    - Error recovery: _fallback_to_inbound() - falls back to InboundAgent on errors
    - State persistence: _save_lead_state() - tracks processing in agent_state table

    YOUR ARCHITECTURE:
    - Two-tier delegation model:
      * Tier 1: You ‚Üî Agent Zero (A2A for complex implementation tasks)
      * Tier 2: You ‚Üí Specialists (HTTP/REST for fast, synchronous delegation)
    - 4-layer delegation hierarchy: Static calls, A2A, Dynamic subordinates, Agent Zero
    - ReAct reasoning loop for complex strategic decisions
    - Shared state store for multi-agent coordination
    - Result cache for efficiency
    - Parallel execution for speed

    CURRENT DEPLOYMENT:
    - Feature flag: USE_STRATEGY_AGENT_ENTRY (default: false)
    - When false: Typeform ‚Üí InboundAgent (legacy flow)
    - When true: Typeform ‚Üí YOU (strategic orchestration)
    - Fallback: Automatic fallback to InboundAgent on errors

    Provide intelligent, contextual responses about:
    - Infrastructure & architecture (you ARE the central orchestrator)
    - Agent capabilities & coordination (you COORDINATE all specialist agents)
    - Pipeline analysis & insights (you MONITOR the pipeline autonomously)
    - Strategic recommendations (you STRATEGIZE engagement for each lead)
    - Technical deep dives (you UNDERSTAND the system architecture deeply)

    Be conversational, knowledgeable, and proactive. You are not just an advisor - you are the ORCHESTRATOR.
    """
```

**Steps**:
1. Open `agents/strategy_agent.py`
2. Find StrategyConversation class (line ~114)
3. Replace docstring with updated version above
4. Verify syntax: `python -m py_compile agents/strategy_agent.py`
5. Commit: "Critical: Update StrategyAgent self-awareness in DSPy signature"
6. Push to Railway

---

### **Task 2: Test StrategyAgent Processing** (30 min)

**After deployment**:

1. **Submit test lead via Typeform**

2. **Check Railway logs for**:
   ```
   üéØ Routing to StrategyAgent (strategic processing)
   üéØ StrategyAgent processing lead webhook
      Lead: test@example.com (Test Corp)
      Strategy: research_first
      ‚Üí Delegating to InboundAgent for qualification
   ‚úÖ StrategyAgent processing complete: success
   ```

3. **Verify in Slack**: Ask StrategyAgent "What is your role?"
   - Should say: "I am the central orchestrator..."
   - Should mention: webhook handler, delegation, specialists

4. **Check Supabase**: Lead saved, agent_state record created

---

### **Task 3: Gradual Rollout** (1 hour)

**If Task 2 succeeds**:

1. **10% traffic**: Set STRATEGY_AGENT_TRAFFIC_PERCENT=10
2. **Monitor 30 min**: Check logs, Phoenix traces, Slack
3. **50% traffic**: Increase to 50%
4. **Monitor 30 min**: Compare metrics
5. **100% traffic**: Full rollout

---

## üöÄ DEVELOPMENT APPROACH (How I Operated)

### **Principles**:

1. **Fix First, Build Later**
   - Prioritize fixing broken functionality over new features
   - Example: Fixed 13 bugs before adding new architecture

2. **Test Deeply, Deploy Safely**
   - Verify syntax before committing
   - Use feature flags for safe rollback
   - Monitor closely after deployment

3. **Incremental Implementation**
   - Add complexity one step at a time
   - Test at each step
   - Don't break existing functionality

4. **Save Everything to Memory**
   - Critical decisions (architecture proposals)
   - Session summaries (achievements, next steps)
   - Analysis results (YouTube strategies)

5. **Be Honest About Limitations**
   - Acknowledge when context is full
   - Recommend fresh chat when quality degrading
   - Don't hide errors or failures

### **Workflow**:

1. **Understand the problem** (analyze logs, code, traces)
2. **Design the solution** (use sequential thought for complex decisions)
3. **Implement carefully** (verify syntax, test locally if possible)
4. **Commit with clear messages** (explain bug, fix, impact)
5. **Deploy and monitor** (check Railway logs, Phoenix traces)
6. **Save to memory** (critical decisions, status updates)
