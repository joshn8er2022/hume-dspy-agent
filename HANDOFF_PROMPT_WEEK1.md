## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE TASKS (Week 1 Completion)

### Task 1: Integrate Memory with InboundAgent (2-3 hours)
**File**: agents/inbound_agent.py

**Changes needed**:
1. Add memory import in __init__:
   ```python
   from memory import get_agent_memory, LeadMemory, LeadTier
   self.memory = get_agent_memory("inbound_agent")
   ```

2. Before qualification, search for similar leads:
   ```python
   similar_leads = await self.memory.search_similar_leads(
       query=f"practice_size:{lead.practice_size} industry:{lead.industry}",
       only_converted=True,
       limit=3
   )
   # Use learnings from similar leads to adapt strategy
   ```

3. After qualification, save to memory:
   ```python
   lead_memory = LeadMemory(
       lead_id=lead.id,
       email=lead.email,
       qualification_score=score,
       tier=tier,
       practice_size=lead.practice_size,
       strategy_used=strategy,
       key_insights=insights
   )
   await self.memory.save_lead_memory(lead_memory)
   ```

### Task 2: Create Migration Script (1-2 hours)
**File**: scripts/migrate_leads_to_memory.py

**Purpose**: Backfill 60 existing leads into memory

**Process**:
1. Query all leads from Supabase
2. For each lead, create LeadMemory
3. Save to FAISS
4. Verify searchability

### Task 3: Test End-to-End (1 hour)
**File**: tests/test_memory_learning.py

**Tests**:
1. Save test lead to memory
2. Search for similar leads
3. Verify retrieval
4. Test strategy adaptation

### Task 4: Deploy and Monitor (1 hour)
1. Push to GitHub
2. Monitor Railway deployment
3. Test in production with real lead
4. Check Phoenix for memory operations
5. Verify learning is working

---

## ðŸ“Š EXPECTED OUTCOMES (Week 1)

**After InboundAgent integration**:
- âœ… Agents remember every lead
- âœ… Agents search for similar past leads
- âœ… Agents adapt strategies based on history
- âœ… 10x better qualification (measurable)
- âœ… Learning compounds over time

**Metrics to monitor in Phoenix**:
- Memory save operations (should see after every lead)
- Memory search operations (should see before qualification)
- Qualification accuracy (should improve)
- Strategy adaptation (should see different approaches for similar leads)

## ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Week 1 complete when**:
1. âœ… InboundAgent uses memory
2. âœ… 60 existing leads migrated
3. âœ… End-to-end learning tested
4. âœ… Deployed to production
5. âœ… Phoenix shows memory operations
6. âœ… Qualification improves (measurable)

**Expected timeline**: 2-3 days of focused work

---

## ðŸ’¡ RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Start with InboundAgent integration** (highest value)
2. **Test with real leads** (validate learning works)
3. **Monitor Phoenix closely** (verify improvements)
4. **Document learnings** (what works, what doesn't)
5. **Iterate quickly** (fix issues as they arise)
