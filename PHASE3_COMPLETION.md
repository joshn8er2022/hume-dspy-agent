## 🎓 Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Multi-Contact Campaigns

lead_data = {
    "account_id": "acc_123",
    "email": "cto@company.com",
    "account_contacts": [
        {"email": "vp@company.com", "title": "VP Engineering"},

    ]
}
```

### 2. Colleague Messaging
```python
message = await orchestrator.generate_colleague_message(
    campaign, target_contact, referring_contact
)
# Output: "Hi Sue, your colleague Dr. John inquired about..."
```

### 3. Channel Escalation
```python
channel = orchestrator.select_channel(campaign, contact)
# Returns: EMAIL → SMS → CALL based on attempts
```

### 4. Conflict Detection
```python
conflict = await orchestrator.check_conflicts(campaign_id)
if conflict["has_conflict"]:
    # Campaign auto-paused
```
