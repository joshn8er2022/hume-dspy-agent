# Technical Audit Request for StrategyAgent

## Context
We just deployed critical bug fixes (commit 385591f) to fix webhook background processing failures. We need a comprehensive technical analysis to verify all systems are working correctly.

## Mission
Perform a deep technical audit of the webhook processing system, agent delegation flow, and database logging. Provide specific evidence from logs, database queries, and system metrics.

---

## Part 1: Webhook Processing Flow Analysis

### 1.1 Recent Webhook Activity
**Query the system to answer:**
- How many webhooks were received in the past 2 hours?
- What was the response time for each webhook?
- Did any webhooks fail? If so, what were the error messages?
- Show the exact timestamps and request IDs for recent webhooks

**Expected Evidence:**
- Query `raw_events` table or application logs
- Show webhook response payloads
- Confirm "processing": "background" responses

### 1.2 Background Task Execution
**Query the system to answer:**
- Are background tasks completing successfully?
- What is the average execution time for background processing?
- Are there any tasks that started but never completed?
- Show the task lifecycle: received → processing → completed

**Expected Evidence:**
- Application log traces showing:
  - `🎯 Webhook accepted - Routing to StrategyAgent (background)`
  - `🔄 Background: StrategyAgent processing started`
  - `✅ Background: StrategyAgent complete - success`

---

## Part 2: Agent Delegation & Communication

### 2.1 StrategyAgent → InboundAgent Delegation
**Query the system to answer:**
- Is StrategyAgent successfully delegating to InboundAgent?
- What HTTP status codes are being returned from delegation calls?
- Are there any datetime serialization errors?
- Show the exact delegation payloads being sent

**Expected Evidence:**
- Log entries showing:
  - `🔗 Delegating to InboundAgent: http://localhost:8080/agents/inbound/qualify`
  - HTTP 200 responses (NOT HTTP 500)
  - No "unhashable type: 'slice'" errors
  - No "datetime is not JSON serializable" errors

### 2.2 InboundAgent Qualification Results
**Query the system to answer:**
- How many leads were qualified in the past 2 hours?
- What tiers were assigned? (SCORCHING, HOT, WARM, COOL, COLD, UNQUALIFIED)
- Were there any qualification failures?
- Show sample qualification reasoning

**Expected Evidence:**
- Query `leads` table: `SELECT id, created_at, qualification_tier, first_name, email FROM leads WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5`
- Confirm leads have valid `qualification_tier` values
- No NULL or "UNKNOWN" tier values

---

## Part 3: Database Logging & State Persistence

### 3.1 agent_state Table Population
**Query the system to answer:**
- Is the `agent_state` table being populated?
- How many state records were created in the past 2 hours?
- Which agents are successfully saving state? (StrategyAgent, InboundAgent, ResearchAgent)
- Show sample state_data JSON structures

**Expected Evidence:**
- Query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM agent_state WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'`
- Should show > 0 rows (table should NOT be empty)
- Query: `SELECT agent_name, lead_id, status, state_data FROM agent_state ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5`
- Confirm state_data contains qualification results, reasoning, scores

### 3.2 Async Supabase Client Verification
**Query the system to answer:**
- Is the async Supabase client initializing correctly?
- Are there any import errors for `create_async_client`?
- Show evidence of successful async database operations

**Expected Evidence:**
- Log entries showing:
  - `✅ Async Supabase client initialized` (should appear in logs)
  - `✅ Saved InboundAgent state for lead abc123...`
  - NO errors: `ImportError: cannot import name 'create_async_client'`

---

## Part 4: Error Analysis & Bug Verification

### 4.1 Recent Errors (Past 2 Hours)
**Query the system to answer:**
- What errors have occurred in the past 2 hours?
- Are there any recurring error patterns?
- Show stack traces for critical errors

**Expected Evidence:**
- Application error logs
- Database query errors
- HTTP request failures

### 4.2 Bug Fix Verification
**Specifically verify these fixes from commit 385591f:**

**Bug 1 - InboundAgent Slicing Error:**
- Search logs for: `TypeError: unhashable type: 'slice'`
- Expected: ZERO occurrences after deployment (was causing HTTP 500)

**Bug 2 - Async Supabase Import:**
- Search logs for: `ImportError: cannot import name 'create_async_client'`
- Expected: ZERO occurrences after deployment

**Bug 3 (From Previous Fix) - Datetime Serialization:**
- Search logs for: `Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable`
- Expected: ZERO occurrences after deployment

---

## Part 5: System Health & Performance Metrics

### 5.1 Pipeline Statistics
**Query the system to answer:**
- How many leads are in each qualification tier?
- What is the lead conversion funnel? (total → qualified → hot/scorching)
- Are pipeline stats showing "UNKNOWN" tiers?

**Expected Evidence:**
- Run: `get_pipeline_stats()` or equivalent query
- Show tier distribution: SCORCHING, HOT, WARM, COOL, COLD, UNQUALIFIED
- Confirm no "UNKNOWN" tier values (this was a previous bug)

### 5.2 Deployment Verification
**Query the system to answer:**
- What code version is currently deployed?
- When was the last deployment?
- Is the deployment showing the correct commit hash?

**Expected Evidence:**
- Log entry showing: `🚀 Deployment: Phase 1 + 1.3 - Async agent_state + FastAPI BackgroundTasks`
- Confirm Railway deployment includes commit `385591f`
- Server start time should be within past 30 minutes

---

## Part 6: End-to-End Flow Verification

### 6.1 Complete Webhook Trace
**For the most recent webhook, trace the complete flow:**

1. **Webhook Receipt** (< 50ms)
   - Show: Request received, payload parsed, background task queued
   - Response: `{"status": "accepted", "processing": "background"}`

2. **Background Processing** (2-15 seconds)
   - Show: StrategyAgent initialized, lead parsed, strategy determined

3. **Delegation** (HTTP POST to InboundAgent)
   - Show: Request payload (with datetime fields properly serialized)
   - Response: HTTP 200 with qualification results

4. **Database Persistence**
   - Show: Lead inserted into `leads` table
   - Show: Agent state saved to `agent_state` table
   - Confirm: Both async and sync operations completed

5. **Completion**
   - Show: Background task marked complete
   - Total time: < 20 seconds

### 6.2 Data Consistency Check
**Verify data consistency across tables:**
- For the most recent lead, confirm:
  - Lead exists in `leads` table
  - Corresponding state exists in `agent_state` table
  - Lead ID matches between tables
  - Timestamps are consistent

## Required Output Format

For each section, provide:

1. **Query/Command Used**: Show the exact tool call or database query
2. **Raw Results**: Show the actual data returned
3. **Analysis**: Your interpretation of the results
4. **Status**: ✅ Working correctly | ⚠️ Warning/Issue | ❌ Critical failure
5. **Evidence**: Specific log entries, database rows, or metrics

---

## Critical Success Criteria

The system is considered **FULLY OPERATIONAL** if:

- ✅ Webhooks respond in < 50ms (BackgroundTasks working)
- ✅ Background tasks complete successfully (no crashes)
- ✅ InboundAgent returns HTTP 200 (no slicing errors)
- ✅ StrategyAgent delegates successfully (no datetime errors)
- ✅ `agent_state` table has new rows (async logging working)
- ✅ `leads` table has new leads with valid tiers
- ✅ ZERO critical errors in past hour
- ✅ All three bug fixes verified (no regression)

If ANY of these criteria fail, mark as ❌ and provide detailed error analysis.

## Timeline & Priority

**Execute this audit in the following order:**

1. **IMMEDIATE (0-2 min)**: Part 4.2 - Bug fix verification (confirm no regressions)
2. **HIGH (2-5 min)**: Part 1 - Webhook flow (confirm BackgroundTasks working)
3. **HIGH (5-8 min)**: Part 2 - Delegation (confirm InboundAgent receiving requests)
4. **MEDIUM (8-12 min)**: Part 3 - Database logging (confirm agent_state populated)
5. **LOW (12-15 min)**: Part 5 - System health metrics
6. **SUMMARY (15-20 min)**: Part 6 - End-to-end trace with final verdict

Total estimated time: 15-20 minutes for comprehensive audit.

## Notes for StrategyAgent

- **Use your ReAct tools**: `audit_lead_flow()`, `query_supabase()`, `get_pipeline_stats()`
- **Access application logs**: Check Railway/Phoenix for recent entries
- **Be thorough**: We need evidence, not assumptions
- **Flag anomalies**: Even minor inconsistencies should be reported
- **Provide actionable insights**: If something is broken, tell us how to fix it

**This is a critical production verification. Take your time and be comprehensive.**
