# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT FIXES - October 26, 2025, 2:21 AM MT

## ✅ Code Fixes Implemented

### Fix #1: InboundAgent Logging (Commit d85a6e8)
- Added comprehensive logging to qualify_lead() method
- Added fallback qualification result when DSPy fails
- Track qualification failures in processing_failures table
- Ensures leads always saved with valid tier

### Fix #2: Slack Channel Configuration
- Issue: SLACK_CHANNEL was set to "ai-test" (channel name)
- Fix: Should be "C09FZT6T1A5" (channel ID)
- Impact: Enables Slack thread creation and follow-up agent triggering

## ⚠️ Environment Variable Changes Required

### Railway Environment Variables to Update:

1. **SLACK_CHANNEL**
   - Current: "ai-test" (channel name)
   - Required: "C09FZT6T1A5" (channel ID)
   - Impact: Fixes Slack thread creation

2. **Verify OPENROUTER_API_KEY**
   - Should be: 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
   - Status: ✅ Confirmed valid by user

## 📊 Current Status (Verified)

### What's Working:
- ✅ Deployment healthy (version 2.1.0-full-pipeline)
- ✅ Supabase connected
- ✅ DSPy qualification working (scores: 12-67, avg: 34.8)
- ✅ Tier classification working (54.4% COLD, 35.3% UNQUALIFIED, 8.8% COOL, 1.5% WARM)

### What's Broken:
- ❌ Slack thread creation (returns None for all leads)
- ❌ Follow-up agent triggering (0 follow-ups sent)
- ❌ processing_failures table doesn't exist

### Root Cause:
- Slack API failing due to channel name vs ID mismatch
- Follow-up agent skipped because slack_thread_ts is None

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Update SLACK_CHANNEL in Railway to "C09FZT6T1A5"
2. Create processing_failures table in Supabase
3. Deploy code fixes (commit d85a6e8)
4. Test with new Typeform submission
5. Verify Slack thread created
6. Verify follow-up agent triggered
